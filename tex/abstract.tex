\thispagestyle{empty}
The creation of auctions for the online marketplace eBay is time consuming and repetitive. The first step for selling an item is taking pictures of it. To complete the auction, the user has to provide a title, description, category and other default parameters. One of the most important step is the definition of a starting price.\\\\
Crowdsourcing is used to generate the required information for a complete auction based on several images. The complex task is split into multiple subtasks. The thesis presents a pure and a hybrid crowdsourcing approach. Different experiments were made to investigate the behaviour of the crowd.\\\\
A promised commission for successful auctions has the biggest influence to the quality of the workers. A majority favours the results of this experiment over the descriptions of the corresponding real online auction. The workers did the most accurate price predictions if the actual market price of the items has been provided.\\\\  
The results of the executed experiments show the potential of the crowd. If all the strength of the single variations will be combined and the task design improved slightly then the generated contents can be used to create real auctions on eBay in the future.
