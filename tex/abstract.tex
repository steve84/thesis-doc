Background: The creation of auctions for the online marketplace eBay is time consuming and repetitive. The first step for selling an item is taking pictures of it. To complete the auction, the user has to provide a title, description, category and other predefined parameters. One of the most important step is the definition of a starting price.\\\\
Method: Crowdsourcing is used to generate the required information for a complete auction based on several images. The complex task is split into multiple subtasks. The thesis presents a pure and a hybrid crowdsourcing approach. Different experiments were made to investigate the behaviour of the crowd.\\\\
