\section{Pure approach}

\subsection{Ground truth}
Real eBay auctions were collected by the API to generate the ground truth for the crowdsourcing experiments. The online auction platform divides their items in eight main categories: Motors, Fashion, Electronics, Collectibles \& Arts, Home \& Garden, Sporting Goods, Toys \& Hobbies and Deals \& Gifts. The ground truth consists of seven items from every category with the exception of the Motor's and Deals \& Gits sections, because the API can't search for items in these categories. First, some keywords were created to touch the desired category: ''Swiss Watch'' (Fashion), ''Smartphone'' (Electronics), ''Football Trading Card'' (Collectibles), ''Coffee Machine'' (Home), ''Soccer shoes'' (Sporting Goods), ''Action Figure'' (Toys) and ''Handbag'' (Fashion). The goal was also to have gender specific and neutral items. An action figure is used by male persons normally, the handbag by females and a smartphone by both. The Finding eBay API provides the method \textit{findCompletedItems} which takes keywords as a parameter and returns a list of completed auction items. The Python script search for the first sold item which uses US dollar as currency, has a description longer than one-hundred characters and contains of at least three images. Only three images were kept, because most of the auctions present the items with a top, front and side view. Another reason is the clarity for the crowdsourcing tasks. Every ground truth entry has the attributes title, description, category, condition, price and image one to three. The following table represents the final ground truth for the further experiments:

\subsection{Tasks workflow}
The macro task of generating an auction on eBay is splited into four simpler micro task:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate a title for the auction item based on the provided images of the item
	\item Generate the description of the item
	\item Find the category of auction item
	\item Define a starting price for the auction
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{images/pipelines/Pure_Pipeline.png}
\caption{Pure Crowdsourcing Pipeline}
\label{purePipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Task design}
At the top of every HIT three images of an auction item are shown. Most of the sellers on eBay present their items with a front, side and top view. Only workers from the United States are allowed to participate in the created tasks, because the ground truth contains only items from there and they have a better feeling for the currency. Some of the tasks need a voting procedure to determine the final answer. The voters have to reason their votes mandatory to understand the strength of the selected answer. At the end of every task the contributors have the possibility to write down a feedback to the requestor.
\subsubsection{Title}
The goal of this subtask is to generate a clear and concise title for the auction item with at most eighty characters. The auction platform eBay provides some recommendations for a good title. It should contain the item's brand name, artist, or designer. A specification of the item could also be helpful. For example the title could include the size, color, condition, and model number. Correct spelling is a must. All these points will be presented to the worker in the instruction section of the task. To make the instructions clear, an example is also listed: 

Title: Sony Playstation 4 (black), 1 Controller, New 

After three titles were created by the crowd, the final title will be elected. If no title receive enough votes, the requester will act as an expert. The expert uses the search engine of the auction platform and decide which title shows more similar items. The Turkers will receive \$0.05 for finding a title and \$0.02 for voting.
\subsubsection{Description}
This subtask is a bit different then the others. An iterative task design is used. First, a worker creates an initial description of the item. Then, the second worker can improve the initial solution or create a new one. Then, the crowd decide which description should be kept and which one should be discarded. One iteration includes an improvement and a voting task. Three iterations were used to generate the description of the auction item. The workers should write approximately five sentences and include specific information like size, color, shape, age, manufacture date, company/author/artist, and notable features or markings. TurKit is a Java application to manage iterative approaches. For an improvement of the text a reward of \$0.2 will be paid, \$0.01 for every participant of the voting procedure.
\subsubsection{Category}
Based on the provided title, the workers have to find the most suitable eBay category for the auction item. The eBay search engine returns one or many categories for a given title. Then the worker has to decide which one matches best. For making a contribution, the workers achieve a payment of \$0.05.
\subsubsection{Price estimation}
The workers have to guess the end price of the online auction item in US dollar. Reasons for the estimation have to be mentioned additionally. The generated title and description are available for a better understanding of the picture contents. The workers have the possibility to list missing information for a more precise estimation. The participants receive a gratification of \$0.05.

Another idea to estimate the starting price is inspired by a German TV game show. The candidate has to predict the cost of an article. After the first guess, the game master answers with 'higher' or 'lower' until the right guess occur or the time is running out. If the player finds out the correct price then she/he will win the object.  
The idea of the show is modified to implement a game with a purpose, similar to the ESP game project \cite{esp}. The general procedure of the game is the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system waits until two independent players are connected and ready to play 
	\item A few pictures, title and description of the article are displayed and the players had to read them first 
	\item Then the game starts and a first guess of the price will be shown by the system 
	\item Both users have to decide if the real price is higher or lower than the displayed one 
	\item Dependent on the previous response, the system will present a higher or lower price until the countdown is expired or there are no guesses left 
	\item The players will receive a score dependent on the difference of the price estimation. A smaller difference leads to a higher score, a higher one to a lower score 
\end{enumerate}
The first guess of the system will be the mean value \( \mu \) of a large number of sold items on eBay. The value can be determined by the eBay API. The guessing structure will be implemented as a directed binary tree. The root node represents the mean value and every following child node will have a lower (left child) \( v_l \) or higher (right child) value  \( v_r \), determined by the value of the parent node  \( v_p \) and the depth  \( d \) of the tree. The following formula calculates the values  of the nodes: 
\begin{equation}
v_l(v_p,d) = v_p - \frac{\mu}{2^d}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
v_r(v_p,d) = v_p + \frac{\mu}{2^d}
\end{equation}
The leafs are integer values which can't be divided by two and represents the final guess of a player. If the time is up and the guesser doesn't reach a leaf node, the value of the actual node is taken. 
The score of the price prediction is determined by a scoring function \( s \), where \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are the price estimations of player 1 and 2.
\begin{equation}
s(x_1,x_2) = 1 - |\varphi(x_1) - \varphi(x_2)|
\end{equation}
The function \( \varphi \) is responsible to normalise the estimations (interval from 0 to 1).
\begin{equation}
\varphi(x) = \frac{x}{2\mu}
\end{equation}
The function is also used to weight the different estimations for the same product. If \( n \) rounds are played for a given object, the final price \( t \) is calculated:
\begin{equation}
t = \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} s(x_{k1},x_{k2})}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} s(x_{i1},x_{i2})\frac{x_{i1}+x_{i2}}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
The reliability \( r \) of the price estimation is the mean score of all played games for the same object:
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} s(x_{i1},x_{i2})\right)
\end{equation}

\section{Hybrid approach}
\subsection{Ground truth}
A lot of sold items were collected by the help of the eBay API. The used methods were the same as in the prior ground truth generation (Chapter x). After all the necessary data were collected, the Python script splits the data shuffled into a training and test set. The training set contains of 70 percent of the whole data. All the consecutively steps (data analysis, feature reduction) will use the training set until the performance of a classifier will be proved on the test set. The ground truth was generated for three different item types:
\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| p{5cm} | l | l | l |}

These features characterise the seller who created the auction. Every user on eBay has the possibility to give a positive, neutral or negative feedback after every transaction. The rating system awards stars with twelve different colors for trustful sellers. After ten positive feedbacks the user receives a yellow star for example. Therefore, the nominal value has to be converted to an integer.
