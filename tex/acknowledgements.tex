First of all, I thank Dr. Gianluca Demartini for the possibility to write my thesis based on a self-defined topic, and for the support and the ideas he was giving me during this time.\\\\
Furthermore, I express gratitude to the eXascale Infolab\footnote{http://www.exascale.info} for giving me the opportunity to execute my experiments and for the helpful remarks after the mid-term presentation.\\\\
I thank my fellow student Marcel W\"ursch for the cooperation over the three years of study and for the tips and inputs during the thesis.\\\\
I thank my family which believe always in me. A full-time study would not have been possible without you.
