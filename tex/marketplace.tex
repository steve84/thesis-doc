\section{History}
eBay was founded 1995 in San Jose (CA) as AuctionWeb by Pierre Omidyar. One year later, eBay bought a third-party licence from Electronic Travel Auction to sell plane tickets and other travelling stuff. During the year 1996, over 200'000 auctions were available on the website. At the beginning of 1997 the number of auctions exploded (about 2 million articles). In the same year the company get their well-known name eBay and received 6.7 million dollar from the venture capital firm Benchmark Capital. The company went public on the stock exchange on September 21, 1998 and the share price increased from 18 to 53.5 dollar on the first day of trading. Four years later the growth continues and eBay bought the online money transfer service PayPal. eBay expanded worldwide in early 2008, had hundred millions of registered users and 15'000 employees. Today, the firm is one of the world's largest online marketplaces. During the fourth quarter of the year 2013 about 128 million active users were reported. A cell phone was sold every 4 seconds, a pair of shoes every 2 seconds and a Ford Mustang every 55 minutes.

\section{Auction item composition}
Every eBay user has the possibility to create auctions for different kind of items. To present the article, the seller has to provide accurate information about it. The standard eBay auction consists of the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Title} The title of the item is limited to 80 characters. The sellers should use descriptive keywords to clearly and accurately convey what they are selling
	\item \textbf{Description} The description is the opportunity to provide the buyers with more information about the item
	\item \textbf{Category} An item can have multiple predefined categories. eBay provides a list of categories which the seller can select
	\item \textbf{Condition} The condition of the item is dependent on the selected category. eBay provides different condition schemas. For clothing items the seller can select between 'New with tags', 'New without tags', 'New with defects' or 'Pre-owned'. For other categories like books, other condition values are present: 'Brand new', 'Like new', 'Very good', 'Good', 'Acceptable'
	\item \textbf{Pictures} To visualise the item the auction creator can upload up to twelve pictures. The first image is important, because it appears next to the item's title in the search result. The pictures will be stored for 90 days on the eBay servers.
	\item \textbf{Shipping costs} The seller has to tell the future buyers how much shipping will cost. There are three possibilities:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Free shipping
		\item Flat shipping, same cost to all buyers
		\item Shipping rate tables, eBay calculates the cost for every individual buyer dependent on the location
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Duration} An auction can have a duration of 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10 days. If the item has a fixed price, the auction is finished if a buyer is willing to pay this price.
	\item \textbf{Pricing} The seller can select a starting price and then the bidding will start at this price. A 'But it now' option is also available. The buyer can skip the bidding process.
	\item \textbf{Payment} The seller has to select the desired paying method like 'PayPal' or 'Payment upon pickup'
\end{itemize}
